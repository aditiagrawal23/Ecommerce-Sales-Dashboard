**Tool Used:**
• Power BI - For data vizualization and presentation
**Aim of the project :** To analyze online sales performance by studying factors such as customer, product category, state, payment mode, and time, and generate insights that help businesses optimize sales strategies, identify profitable customer segments, and understand payment preferences.
**Business Problem:** E-commerce businesses often struggle to monitor their sales and profitability across multiple dimensions. Without proper insights, it becomes difficult to identify top-performing products, customer segments, and regions. Businesses also lack visibility into seasonal sales patterns and payment preferences, which impacts decision-making for marketing, inventory, and customer retention strategies.
**Approach & Solution:** I started by importing and cleaning the sales dataset in MS Excel to remove inconsistencies. After preparing the data, I modeled it in Power BI, creating relationships between customers, products, regions, and transactions. I then built calculated measures and KPIs (Total Sales, Quantity, Profit, and AOV) to transform raw data into actionable insights.
**Insights:** 
-A detailed analysis revealed valuable findings:

-Clothing (63%) was the most purchased product category, contributing the largest share of sales.

-Cash on Delivery (44%) was the most preferred payment method, followed by UPI (21%).

-Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh were among the top contributing states for sales revenue.

-Sales showed clear seasonal patterns, with peaks in Q1 and Q4, while some months (e.g., June–August) recorded losses.

-Certain customers such as Harivansh and Madhav contributed significantly higher sales compared to others.
**Key KPIs included:**

-Total Sales (438K)

-Quantity Sold (5615 units)

-Total Profit (36.96K)

-Average Order Value (121K)

**Visualizations created:**

-Bar charts to track customer-wise and state-wise sales contribution.

-Donut charts for analyzing product category mix (Clothing, Electronics, Furniture) and payment mode distribution (COD, UPI, Debit Card, EMI, Credit Card).

-Clustered bar & line charts for month-wise profit and sales performance.

-Profit trend chart by month showing seasonality, growth, and decline periods.

**Data modeling and transformation**:

-Created relationships between multiple datasets (sales, customers, products, and geography).

-Added calculated fields for KPIs like Profit %, Sales Growth, and AOV.

-Implemented parameters and slicers for user-driven customization.

**Conclusion:** Helped identify top-performing customers, states, and product categories, and provided clear insights into payment preferences and seasonal profit fluctuations. This enabled data-driven decision-making for sales and marketing strategies.
-Clothing (63%) drove the highest sales, making it the most profitable product category.
